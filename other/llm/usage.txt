#User: I'm getting error for this code: Error in `tibble()`:
! Tibble columns must have compatible sizes.
• Size 84: Existing data.
• Size 89: Column `Death_Toll`.
ℹ Only values of size one are recycled.
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

code: library(tibble)

# Define the genders vector
genders <- c("Male", "Female")

# Simulate data using tibble
simulated_data <- tibble(
  # for years 2017-2023 and for each month
  Year_Death = rep(c(2017:2023), each = 12),
  # run death toll
  Death_Toll = runif(89, min = 0, max = 200),
  Age_group = runif(89, min = 18, max = 70),
  Gender = sample(genders, 89, replace = TRUE)
)

# Print the simulated data
print(simulated_data)

ChatGPT: The error message indicates that there's a size mismatch between the existing data and the `Death_Toll` column you're trying to create. It seems like you're trying to create a tibble with 84 rows of existing data and then adding a `Death_Toll` column with 89 values.

Let's correct this by ensuring that the number of rows for the `Death_Toll` column matches the number of rows for the existing data. Since you mentioned simulating data for years 2017-2023 (which is 7 years), each year with 12 months, we should have 7 * 12 = 84 rows for the data.

Here's the corrected code:

```R
library(tibble)

# Define the genders vector
genders <- c("Male", "Female")

# Simulate data using tibble
simulated_data <- tibble(
  # for years 2017-2023 and for each month
  Year_Death = rep(c(2017:2023), each = 12),
  # run death toll (84 values, one for each row)
  Death_Toll = runif(84, min = 0, max = 200),
  Age_group = runif(84, min = 18, max = 70),
  Gender = sample(genders, 84, replace = TRUE)
)

# Print the simulated data
print(simulated_data)
```

In this code, we've adjusted the `runif` function to generate 84 random values for `Death_Toll` and `Age_group`, matching the number of rows in the data frame. This should resolve the size compatibility issue.
