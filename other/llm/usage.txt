LLM: ChatGPT-4.
April 17th 2024

#User: I'm getting error for this code: Error in `tibble()`:
! Tibble columns must have compatible sizes.
• Size 84: Existing data.
• Size 89: Column `Death_Toll`.
ℹ Only values of size one are recycled.
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

code: library(tibble)

# Define the genders vector
genders <- c("Male", "Female")

# Simulate data using tibble
simulated_data <- tibble(
  # for years 2017-2023 and for each month
  Year_Death = rep(c(2017:2023), each = 12),
  # run death toll
  Death_Toll = runif(89, min = 0, max = 200),
  Age_group = runif(89, min = 18, max = 70),
  Gender = sample(genders, 89, replace = TRUE)
)

# Print the simulated data
print(simulated_data)

ChatGPT: The error message indicates that there's a size mismatch between the existing data and the `Death_Toll` column you're trying to create. It seems like you're trying to create a tibble with 84 rows of existing data and then adding a `Death_Toll` column with 89 values.

Let's correct this by ensuring that the number of rows for the `Death_Toll` column matches the number of rows for the existing data. Since you mentioned simulating data for years 2017-2023 (which is 7 years), each year with 12 months, we should have 7 * 12 = 84 rows for the data.

Here's the corrected code:

```R
library(tibble)

# Define the genders vector
genders <- c("Male", "Female")

# Simulate data using tibble
simulated_data <- tibble(
  # for years 2017-2023 and for each month
  Year_Death = rep(c(2017:2023), each = 12),
  # run death toll (84 values, one for each row)
  Death_Toll = runif(84, min = 0, max = 200),
  Age_group = runif(84, min = 18, max = 70),
  Gender = sample(genders, 84, replace = TRUE)
)

# Print the simulated data
print(simulated_data)
```

In this code, we've adjusted the `runif` function to generate 84 random values for `Death_Toll` and `Age_group`, matching the number of rows in the data frame. This should resolve the size compatibility issue.

User: fix error and change graph : home2017 <- home_data %>%
  filter(Year_of_death == 2017) %>%
  count(Cause_of_death, Age_group) %>%
  top_n(10, n)  # Filter for the top 10 causes of death

# Plot the top 10 causes of death
ggplot(home2017, aes(x = fct_reorder(Age_group, n), y = n, fill = Cause_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Death Count", fill = "Cause of Death")

chatgpt: Got it! If you prefer a different visual style for your graphs, we can explore some alternatives to the default ggplot2 style. Here's an example using the theme_bw() function to create a black and white theme for your plot:

R
Copy code
# Filter for the year 2017 and count occurrences of Cause_of_death and Age_group
home2017 <- home_data %>%
  filter(Year_of_death == 2017) %>%
  count(Cause_of_death, Age_group) %>%
  top_n(10, n)  # Filter for the top 10 causes of death

# Plot the top 10 causes of death with a black and white theme
ggplot(home2017, aes(x = fct_reorder(Age_group, n), y = n, fill = Cause_of_death)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw() +  # Black and white theme
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Death Count", fill = "Cause of Death")
This code uses theme_bw() to set a black and white theme for your plot. You can further customize the theme or explore other themes provided by ggplot2 to achieve the visual style you prefer. Let me know if you'd like to try a different theme or if there's anything else you'd like to adjust in the plot!

### Aspects of the paper were error/ grammar checked my chagpt. Due to the sheer size of the paper and feedback I was not able to put the whole chat history onto this file.
